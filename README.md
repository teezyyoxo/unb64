**unb64** is a simple, clean SwiftUI utility for macOS (and iOS-compatible) that lets you convert Base64-encoded text to plain text — and vice versa — **in real time**.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔀 **Bi-directional conversion:**  
  - **Left:** Decode Base64 to plain text.
  - **Right:** Encode plain text to Base64.
- ⚡ **Instant:** Updates as you type — no “Convert” button needed.
- 🗑️ **Clear buttons:** Quickly reset input fields.
- 📋 **Copy buttons:** Copy decoded or encoded output with one click.
- ✅ **Confirmation:** Small “Copied!” message confirms success.
- 🖥️ Built in **SwiftUI** — lightweight, modern, local-first.
